	            	<p>Talking Tree Farm began as a lifestyle choice, followed by a big dream. A dream and calling to leave the world a better place. The study of permaculture and a lot of support from family and friends opened doors for this dream to become a reality. The fact that we can feed and fuel our community with the best produce available is a rewarding benefit to preserving the earth, or at the very least, leaving it the way it was and should be for future generations.</p>
	            	<p>For ten years Sylvain went back and forth between Thailand and France studying nature and creating different gardens. He learned skills like carpentry and sustainable living. Sarah and Sylvain's meeting in the South of Thailand while she was teaching there brought a whole new chapter to their lives. They shared the same dreams and fell in love. They moved to Sarah's hometown in Texas to find a once in a life time opportunity awaiting them. A close family friend wanted Sylvain and Sarah to transform his land into a magnificent food forest, now known by the name of Talking Tree Farm.</p>
