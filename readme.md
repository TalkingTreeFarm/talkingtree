### Overview
The purpose of this project is to develop a website for Talking Tree Farm, a local organic farm in San Antonio, which will provide them with features to help grow their business and educate visitors about all things organic!

### Key Features
This website will include multiple different features which allow Talking Tree Farm to easily share their knowledge about organic farming and also allow their customers to effortlessly access this content as well as order a weekly basket of fresh produce.

Such features include...
  * **Educational Articles**
    * This feature allows Talking Tree Farm to publish and maintain articles and tutorials about organic farming and other related content.
    * Articles can contain videos, pictures and text, allowing Talking Tree Farm to publish in depth tutorials, tips and tricks with a written summary of key points.
    * Talking Tree Farm will be able to effortlessly add a link to any article which will redirect the visitor to a calendar of events, where they can RSVP for an upcoming event or even schedule a tour of the farm!
  * **Events Calendar**
    * Who doesn't like to visit a farm on a beautiful spring day? With this feature, Talking Tree Farm will be able to easily keep their audience informed of upcoming events at the farm, from tours to lessons and more!
    * This feature doesn't only make it easy for Talking Tree Farm to schedule events. It also makes it simple for visitors to the website to RSVP for an upcoming event and even contact Talking Tree Farm for information about private tours and lessons. No registration required!
  * **Real Time Inventory Tracking**
    * Running a farm is no easy task, and this feature will make that task just a little bit easier. Both Talking Tree Farm and their customers will be able to see, in real time, exactly what is available each week, as well as how much of each item is available. This figure will be easy to update by the farmers, so customers will always know exactly what produce is available.
    * Unfortunately, fresh produce does grow on trees (well, some of it anyway). This takes time, and there will always be a finite supply. Because of this, customers who aren't able to secure a basket before supply runs out will be able to put themselves on a wishlist in the event that extra baskets can be assembled later in the week.
  * **Online Ordering**
    * Currently, Talking Tree Farm offers two ways for customers to purchase baskets of fresh, organic produce. They can either purchase them in person at one of the two markets where Talking Tree Farm sells on Sundays, or they can contact the farmers to arrange for pickup at the farm itself. With this feature, customers will be able to reserve a basket online, using Paypal, so that they can be guaranteed a basket when they arrive at the market.
    * We mentioned Paypal right? Talking Tree Farm is looking to expand their services to include home delivery in certain areas. Using Paypal, this will make it incredibly easy for the customer to order a basket and have it delivered right to their door! Customers can even set up a recurring payment, ensuring that they get their farm fresh produce every week without having to continuously reserve an order.

### Technologies
Websites don't just appear out of thin air (although that would be awesome)! This website will be built using technologies such as...
  * HTML5
  * CSS3, with SASS pre-processing
  * JavaScript, with jQuery and other libraries
  * MySQL
  * PHP5, with the Laravel 4.2 framework
  * Node Gulp, for task automation
  * Github, with Zenhub integration for easy project management

### Potential Challenges
Nothing worth doing is ever easy, and the same goes for developing web applications. No doubt, we will face many challenges along the way such as organization and bugs! However, there are a few challenges which we can predict with this project...
  * **Responsive Design**
    * While it isn't exactly difficult to make a website mobile friendly, our client does not have easy access to a computer. Their main medium for accessing the internet is an Apple iPad. Due to this, we will have to ensure that their user experience for adding articles, managing inventory and tracking orders is just as fluid and elegant on a tablet as it would be on a laptop or desktop computer.
  * **Ticket Management**
    * Customer service is a major part of any business. When a customer orders a basket or RSVPs for an event, our client needs to have an easy way to track and process this information. While we could implement email alerts for our client, this isn't the most efficient way to handle this problem and, as such, we will need to find an elegant solution for our client.
  * **Paypal Integration**
    * Sure, Paypal has an API which allows easy embedding into a website, but none of us have ever implemented it before. That's not the tricky part though! We are not satisfied with a button that kicks the user out of the site and onto another page. That makes for a pretty jarring user experience. We would like to find a way to make this as seamless as possible.
    * It isn't all about our client's customers having a good user experience though! Tying into ticket management, our client needs to be able to see when a customer has prepaid with Paypal, ideally without having to resort to email alerts.
  * **Time Management**
    * Time is always a factor on any project, but this is our group's first flirtation with a real deadline. Project and time management will be key here, but we have faith in our abilities to deliver an outstanding product on time!

### Credits
Everyone has mentors and other people in their lives who support them every step of the way. To you, our family, friends, teachers and even that crazy homeless guy on the corner who makes us laugh with his jokes and stories, we would like to say thank you. We would not be where we are today without your support and devotion.
